# Unicorn

**Note: ** I broke the Unicorn interpreter. I'll try to fix it later, maybe with more magics 

There is this amazing thing called the unicorn emoji: ðŸ¦„ so I did the obvious thing and make a language based off it!

Half joke, half actual attempt at golfing language.

## Documentation

Unicorn is based off unicorns! Unicorn translates to JavaScript.
